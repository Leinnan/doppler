[![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~leinnan/doppler/commits/.build.yml.svg)](https://builds.sr.ht/~leinnan/doppler/commits/.build.yml?)

My OpenGL engine. I want to recreate look and feel from PS1 console using more modern tech. I dont recommend to use it but feel free to check it out if you want to. At least for now I treat it as learning project and API and everything can and will change. My plan is to get working engine and start making games ASAP and based on that make changes and improvements in engine.

Features for now:
- input support with winit
- openGL bindings based on glutin
- imgui support with support for inspect for structs
- basic lighting support
- skybox
- postprocess shader
